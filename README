Preview plugin is a tool developed to help you to preview markup files such as *.markdown, *.rdoc, *.textile and *.html when you are editing them. It builds html files and opens them in your browser.

The plugin requires a builtin ruby interpreter. It means that your Vim should be compiled with '--enable-rubyinterp' option. To find out does you Vim have builtin ruby interpreter you can do the next:
    :echo has('ruby')
If output is '1' the ruby interpreter is builtin. The second thing you should verify is that you have installed all necessary ruby gems. 

Supported formats and dependecies:
    * markdown(md, mkd, mkdn, mdown) - depends on 'bluecloth' ruby gem
    * rdoc -  depends on 'github-markup' ruby gem
    * textile - depends on 'RedCloth' ruby gem
    * ronn  -depends on 'ronn' ruby gem
    * html(htm) - no dependecies
   * reStructuredText(rst) - depends on 'RbST' ruby gem and 'rst2html' system util
